Open-Needs Example Data
=======================
This folder contains json-files, which define useful test data.

It can be installed by ``python install_data.py <file-name>``.
E.g. ```python install_data.py rocketlab.json``.

This data is also used for test cases, so changes here may break the related test cases.
